## Documentation

### ensureineinealized

The method must be called freely want to be after ** on ** / before the method ** on ** but I suggest before ** on **

**example:**

`` `Python
  whisperpythonzerounintezaragler.ensureinitialized (librarypath = "fork/dependencies/lib/libWhisper_python.so")
`` `

### Initialized

This method must be called after the ** on ** method because to process updates

**example:**

`` `Python
  Await whisperpythonzerounintezaragler.initialized ()
`` `

### On

This method is useful for getting data updates from invokes / updates

**example:**

`` `Python

  def on_callback (update: dict):
    print (update)

  whisperpythonzerounintezaragler.on (event_name = "update", on_callback = on_callback)
  
`` `


### Loadmodelfromfilepath

Make sure you load the model first so you can transcribe

**example:**

`` `Python
    result = await whisperpythonzerounintezaragler.loadmodelfromfilepath (whispermodelfilekat = "../../../ big-data/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin")
    print (result)
`` `


### TransCRIBEFROMFILEKATH

transcribe to get text

**example:**

`` `Python
    translate = await whisperpythonzerounintezaragler.transCribefromfilekat (file_path = "../../../../ fork/whisper.cpp/samples/jfk.mp3")
    print (translate)
`` `
